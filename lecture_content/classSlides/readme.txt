Originally, the plan was to develop the lectures using Latex to create Beamer
presentations, but due to time constraints, Beamer was abandoned and we will be
finishing the lectures in PowerPoint. Thus, all the Latex directories and
template files have been put into an archive/ directory.

Each of the six pattern lectures developed by students in the CIS 607 Parallel
Computing Course Development Seminar course has its own directory with its own
template in PowerPoint.

Notes to Lecture Team: 
- Please commit your PPT and PDF files by Monday, March 10 COB.
- For consistency, end your lecture with some sort of an example (not used in
  the lab material) to demonstrate how the pattern is used in the real world.
- For consistency, when cropping pictures from the SPP PDF text, just take the
  image (i.e. no Figure X label, horizontal line, or wordy caption underneath)
