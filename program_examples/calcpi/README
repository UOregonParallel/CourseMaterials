//---------------------
DEPENDENCIES
//---------------------
Before compiling, you will need to have a gcc, g++, and icpc compiler. In addition, you will need the tbb library.

//---------------------
COMPILE PROGRAMS ON MIST
//---------------------
gcc -o calcpi_omp -fopenmp calcpi_openmp.c
g++ -o calcpi_tbb -L/usr/local/packages/intel_xe/14.0.1/tbb/lib/intel64/gcc4.1 -ltbb calcpi_tbb.cpp
icpc -o calcpi_cilk calcpi_cilk.cpp

//---------------------
PROGRAM EXECUTION
//---------------------
A script called 'runProgram.sh' has been created to automatically compile and 
run the example program in three languages. The script will print the output
to a text file called 'sampleOutput.txt'.

//---------------------
BUGS & ERRORS
//---------------------
In the process of fixing the TBB version.
