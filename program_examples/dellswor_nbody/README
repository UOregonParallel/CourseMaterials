Basic N-Body simulation code

The code in this directory demonstrates a really naive N-Body simulation. Our solar system is modelled with point masses, collisions are not acconted for. Parallel implementations use parallel for constructions.

When run using the OVA on an older iMac with a VM having 2 virtual processors, runtimes are longer when parallel.
