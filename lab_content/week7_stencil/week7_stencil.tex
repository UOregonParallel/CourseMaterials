		\begin{columns}
			\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
          Our current procedure for identifying spacecraft in space surveillance photos is to display a photo to an intern, who presses a button if a spacecraft is present. However, we are having severe problems with interns falling asleep or otherwise not paying attention.
          \\~\\
          We would like to automate the process of identifying spacecraft, in order to improve reliability and so that interns can be reassigned to coffee-making duties.

			Our initial efforts at using edge detection successfully detects the spacecraft, but also produces a large amount of other edges resulting from stars, galaxies, pulsars, and other non-spacecraft objects.

		~\\~\\
		Our current project is to apply a Gaussian blur filter to incoming images, softening the edges in order to isolate objects with sharper edges, such as UFOs.

	\begin{frame}[t]{Gaussian Blur Definition}
		A Gaussian blur is generated by, for each pixel, producing a weighted average of itself and adjacent pixels, where the weights are determined by a Gaussian function.\\
		\begin{equation*}
			G(x,y) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma^2} e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \sigma^2}}
		\end{equation*}
		~\\
		where $\sigma$ is the desired standard deviation for the Gaussian curve and $x$ and $y$ are distance from the center pixel. We generally consider only a limited neighborhood around each pixel, such as a $3 \times 3$ radius. These values can be pre-computed and then normalized so that they sum to one.
		\\~\\
		This is a \textbf{stencil} operation: each output depends on a ``neighborhood'' of inputs specified using a set of fixed offsets relative to the output position.
