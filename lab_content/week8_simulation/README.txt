O-SNAP is investing in drones. To support AI development, a drone simulator has been provided by the vendor. You will find the code for the simulator in the src directory.

The provided simulator only support testing one AI at a time. We would like to have the simulator enhanced to support multiple connected AIs. Any other performance enhancements would also be appreciated.
