Office of Strategic National Alien Planning

Mission:
To prepare national contingency plans for real and imagined alien invasion scenarios.

History:
The Office of Strategic National Alien Planning (O-SNAP) was started by William McKinely in 1897 as a response to the Aurora incident. His predecessor, Grover Cleveland had failed to act in 1894 on H.G.Wells' warnings of emanate extraterrestrial invasion. Forsaking official channels, H.G. Wells prepared The War Of The Worlds serial in a desperate attempt to stir national and international attention to the pressing issue.

Since its founding, O-SNAP has played a major role in managing public fear regarding alien invasion. Using carefully orchestrated campaigns of media control, subliminal messaging, and technical advancement releases, O-SNAP has a track record of success discrediting and covering up extraterrestrial events that would lead to public panic.
