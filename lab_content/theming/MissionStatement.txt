Office of Strategic National Alien Planning

Mission:
To prepare national contingency plans for real and imagined alien invasions.

History:
The Office of Strategic National Alien Planning (O-SNAP) was started by William McKinely in 1897 as a response to the Aurora incident. Since its founding, O-SNAP has played a major role in managing public fear regarding alien invasion. Using carefully orchestrated campaigns of media control, subliminal messaging, and alien technology releases, O-SNAP has maintained the status quo by discrediting and covering up extraterrestrial events that would otherwise lead to public panic.
