In association with your enrollment in the Parallel Programming course at the University of Oregon, you have been selected to participate in the O-SNAP pseudo-internship program. Congratulations! 

The pseudo-internship training replaces/is the lab component for the Parallel Programming course. Officially the training cannot be required since labs did not appear on the registrars schedule this term; attending training is highly recommended. Over your 10 week pseudo-internship you will develop parallel programming skills with three technologies: OpenMP, CilkPlus, and Thread Building Blocks (TBB). You will also learn about 6 parallel patterns.

The training projects have 100% overlap with the programming activities you will be graded on for the course. Expect to complete 2 short programs each week in all three languages as well as a substantial term project with a small group (3-4 students). We expect final project proposals to be approved by the end of week 5.

O-SNAP on-boarding is scheduled in the NIC conference room from 800 to 1700 (8a to 5p) on March 31, 2014. The NIC conference room is 474 Streisinger (an inner office of 470 Streisinger). Please be advised that 470 Streisinger cannot be accessed directly; you will need to use the 4th floor of LISB or Klamath to reach the room. The on-boarding process will familiarize you with the location of training room, account activation on our cluster resources, and assist in training scheduling.

Sincerely,

Congratulations on your 10 week pseudo-internship with O-SNAP. Given that you will be receiving 4 upper division credit hours toward your university transcript, O-SNAP expects roughly 12 work hours per week of effort. 5 of the hours will be reserved for mandatory meetings and training (lectures and labs); scheduling of the remaining 7+ hours will be at your discretion. Time sheets will not be required since we trust that you are highly motivated to improve your skills and prevent the alien apocalypse.

10 weeks is not a lot of time to make a difference so you'll want to get started early. Please form a project team with 1 or 2 of your peers to work on one of the active O-SNAP projects. We anticipate that multiple teams will be working on the same project. To promote a healthy sense of competition among our interns, a leader board will track the performance of each team's solution.
