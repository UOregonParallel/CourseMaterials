Internal Memorandum
Date:    March 31, 2014
To:      Interns
From:    Secretary of the Office of Strategic National Alien Planning
Subject: Welcome to the Office of Strategic National Alien Planning

Congratulations on your 10 week pseudo-internship with O-SNAP. Given that you will be receiving 4 upper division credit hours toward your university transcript, O-SNAP expects a minimun of 16 work hours per week of effort. 4 of the hours will be reserved for mandatory meetings and training (lectures and labs); scheduling of the remaining 12+ hours will be at your discretion. Time sheets will not be required since we trust that you are highly motivated to improve your skills and prevent the alien apocalypse.

10 weeks is not a lot of time to make a difference so you'll want to get started early. Please form a project team with 1 or 2 of your peers to work on one of the active O-SNAP projects. We anticipate that multiple teams will be working on the same project. To promote a healthy sense of competition among our interns, a leader board will track the performance of each team's solution.

O-SNAP training will also promote healthy competition. O-SNAP training exercises will generally have an associated deliverable program. Training exercises are to be completed individually and a leader board will be provided to highlight the most performant solutions.
