There are makefiles in each of the three program folders. In order to compile
any of the programs you must FIRST modify the makefile. There are two 
predifined sets of build rules, one that may run on your desktop if you 
have the necessary preresiquites, and one that will run on MIST. Just uncomment
the appropriate one and it should work.

Prerequisites:
opencv: version 2.4.2+
tbb:
gcc: 4.6+ prefered

MIST
you will need to 'module load opencv' in order to get the opencv libraries
as well as a newer gcc version.
